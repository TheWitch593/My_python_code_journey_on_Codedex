# 🐍 Codedex Python Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repository!

This is a collection of Python code from the [Codedex Python course](https://www.codedex.io/python) and its challenge packs. As a B.Sc. Computer Science student, I’m documenting my learning journey—from understanding core programming concepts to applying them through hands-on practice. This repository reflects my progress, growth, and dedication to clean and meaningful code.
